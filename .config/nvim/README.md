This is my minimal and fast Neovim config (borrow lots of things and heavily inspired from https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config)

Setup Python LSP Server with:
```bash
pip3 install python-lsp-server
```

Setup Typescript Language Server with:
```bash
npm i -g typescript typescript-language-server
```
